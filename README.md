A cell phone has become a basic necessity than just a luxury. In this era, each and everyone has their cell phones. We often tend to wonder which phone would be the best for me? So why don't we play around and find it ourselves? <br>
After extensive analysis and visualization of the data, we build 2 models that help us predict the price of a phone and then predict which phone would be the best fit for an appropriate group.

* Model 1 <br>
We use 2 regression models which are "Linear and Ridge Regression" and achieve 100% accuracy.

* Model 2 <br>
We use 3 classifier models which are "Random Forest, K-NN, and Decision Tree" and achieve ~96% accuracy in each model.
